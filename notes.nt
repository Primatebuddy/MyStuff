FUNNY PATHS IN GITHUB {
  #The reason some paths in github are combined is that the directories
  in the path are empty, so github combines them. If you hover over it
  you will see a tooltip that reads "this path skips through empty directories"
}

SSH KEYS IN GITHUB {
  # create key: ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
  # add it to github (profile->settings->SSH and GPG keys)
  # test key: ssh -vT git@github.com
  # set repo to use ssh:
  git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Primatebuddy/MyStuff.git
