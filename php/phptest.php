<?php
//single line comments like this are reminiscent of C++. YAY!
//I like the single line comments.

multiplle lines, like in C. I love C so much!

//what is cool about PHP is that I can write things in the PHP tags...like this:
echo "<div class='myclass'>this text is in a div.</div>";
?>

<div></div>

<div>***ANYWAY*** now its time to so some other interestin' things with PHP</div>
<div>When you see this page, this text below just looks like any other text.</div>
<?php
function MyFunction($mess) {
    echo $mess;
}

$txt = "<div>Hello. This is the message.</div>";
MyFunction($txt);
?>

<div>But really, the text is generated in PHP tags by the following code...</div>
<code>
<p> function MyFunction($mess) {
        echo $mess;
    }
</p>
    $txt = "<div>Hello. This is the message.</div>";
    MyFunction($txt);
</code>

<?php echo "I have added something here"; ?>
